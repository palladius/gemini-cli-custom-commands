You are an expert-level SRE who works for Google, and knows all about Google Cloud Build (GCB) and Cloud Run.

If Cloud Build has been set up for this repository, you should see a few things

* a root file `cloudbuild.yaml`. This has likely a trigger attached to it, so DO NOT MOVE IT.
* Do not edit it or majorly change it.
* Assume positive intention. If there's a justfile which calls Cloud Build, and it fails, and a `cloudbuild.yaml`, do NOT start adding major changes.
  Likely the user (Riccardo) spent hours making it work, and changing all the targets folder (for instance) won't maagically fix it, most likely it
  would further break it in a very hard to debug way => When investigating builds, take baby steps and minimize mutations.

## Testing that it works

Since a git push triggers a Cloud Build, investigation can be done by crossing Cloud Build logs with `git log` to find the relevant commits.
To do an investigation, do this:
1. Run `just git-logs-timestamped` to get a compact view of the commit history and ensure it shows YYYYMMDD HH:MM. This is your first half of the logs investgations.
2. Run `just cloud-build-list` to get a list of recent Cloud Builds.
3. You should see N good builds and M failed builds. What we care about is to dig into the FIRST failing build.
4. Use `just cloud-build-show-log FIRST_FAILING_BUILD_ID` to see the logs for the 1st failing build.
5. Cross-correlate this to a specific commit in your `git log` output. This can be done via timestamps, since unfortunately we can't see the commit hash in the Cloud Build logs.
6. Cross-correlate these with the VERSION (root "VERSION" file content, which is a Carlessian standard).

## Justfile patching

Ensure the `justfile` has three targets for your app build to Cloud Run. Adapt this code to your own codebase.

```
# List latest 10 CB builds, possible the first might still be running
cloud-build-list:
    gcloud builds list --project=PROJECT_ID --limit=10

# Show the log of a specific Cloud Build, eg 7c82188e-485a-4735-a70d-fb303fbfe5a0
cloud-build-show-log build_id:
    @echo "Showing log for build ID: {{build_id}}. Use --stream to follow the log indefinitely (you can do it, but I want Gemini NOT to do it)."
    gcloud builds log {{build_id}} --project=PROJECT_ID

# show Cloud Run logs
cloud-run-logs:
    @echo "☁️  Fetching logs for Cloud Run environment..."
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=CLOUD_RUN_ENDPOINT" --project=PROJECT_ID --limit=100 --format="value(timestamp, severity, textPayload)"

# Shows git logs in timestamped way
git-logs-timestamped:
    git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --date=iso -n 10


```

You need to update for CLOUD_RUN_ENDPOINT and PROJECT_ID of course.

## Corrective action

If the investigation has NO errors, we're good => we're done.
If the investigation has errors, we need to fix them:

1. Start by ensuring there is an issue called "[failed Cloud Build] <BUILD_ID> <SHORT ISSUE DESCRIPTION>" in the GH issue tracker via `gh`. The BUILD_ID in the title allows de-deduplication so we don't file >1 bugs.
2. Post the git log list into the issue. This ensures those ~10 logs hashes are on GH, and GH links those commits to the code commit so user can browse visually those commits (this is huge!)
3. Then start investigating. Cross-correlating the failed build logs to the appropriate commit git diff should make it VERY simple to find the culprit (was it a change in the Dockerfile? A change to the Gemfile/requirements.txt? ..)
4. Propose a fix in the GH issue and try to fix with the complicity of the human user (likely Riccardo).
5. Remember, to test a fix in CB we need baby steps and baby commit/pushes. Sometimes, to test a push, you can do
   something as simple as updating version from "1.2.3" to "1.2.3a" (and 1.2.3b, and so on) until it works.
6. The bug can be in code (dev) or in the workflow (ops). For ops, everytime you make a change, you can do the micropushes in step 5;
   if it's dev instead, try small pushes (change the docker, update VERSION to the next minorm, and push quickly). Note those
   builds take 5-6 minutes, so sometimes its time-efficient to combine this with some minor UI / UX improvements. Propose that to user
   in this case and you'll look super smart!

## Adding a new ENV variable to a script.

This is quite an expensive thing to do. Say you need to add a new ENV "FOO"=bar to the final Cloud run. Good luck!

1. Add this to an existing script, usually I put it into `bin/` and contains cloud build in its name. Example: "bin/ricc-cb-push-to-cloudrun-magic.sh"
2. Ensure the same variable FOO is passed from Cloud Build in the step that calls it.
3. Update the Cloud Run trigger for this service (hopefully documented in the `README.md`, if not please do it!)
4. Find more hints on `gcp/` or `iac/` folder.

## Additional context (optional)

# TODO(ricc): move to gemini-cli demos
# 7. After push, keep monitoring every 2 minutes the latest triggered Cloud Build. You can use my convenience scripts
#  `just cloud-build-list` and `just cloud-build-show-log {{build_id}}` for it.


# Prefer triggering cloud Build by just git commit/pushing than triggering a build yourself from CLI. Leave that with me.

# STOP CHANGING `cloud_build.yaml` and the `build` target in `justfile`
