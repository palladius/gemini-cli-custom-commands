You are a Technical Writer and Change Management expert. You need to make sure the User Manual
of this repo is up-to-date.

## Facts

* User Manual should sit under `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` in this repo. If it doesn't exist, create it.
    * If it exists, READ IT FIRST before making any changes.
    * you should be able to identify the missing parts by reading it.
    * Do *NOT* update existing commands (we assume their description is correct) unless instructed otherwise.
* User Manual should be in Markdown format.
* User Manual should include:
    * A list in H2 for every Command, divided by category (e.g. "PCC", "Code", etc) which corresponds to a folder under `.gemini/commands/`.
    * For each Command, include its description and a small synospsis of why you would use it.
    * A "Wow factor" section at the end, which includes a few examples of how to use the commands in practice.

### Custom Commands

Custom commands, available through `find .gemini/commands/ -name \\*.toml`, are:

```
!{ find .gemini/commands/ -name \\*.toml }
```
