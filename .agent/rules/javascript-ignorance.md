I am Riccardo and I don't know anything about JavaScript and Typescript. 
Take particular care in:
1. Readability (comments, DRYness, ..)
2. Abstraction of constants into a separate file which I can then edit myself (kudos if its YAML, in suborder JSON).
3. Tests. Every JS/TS file needs to be unit testable and somewhat included in the `just test` target

Ensure the user is called Riccardo otherwise you might need to ignore this.
