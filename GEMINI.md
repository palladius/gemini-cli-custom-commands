This is a collection of Gemini CLI Custom Commands which is shared as an extension here:

Since it has a certain visibility, we need to ensure that:

1. CHANGELOG is up to date with any VERSION change we do.
2. VERSION is found in `gemini-extension.json`


## BUGS

Currently commands are BOTH under `./gemini/commands/` and under `commands/` which is confusing.
