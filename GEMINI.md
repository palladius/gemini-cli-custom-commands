This is a collection of Gemini CLI Custom Commands which is shared as an extension here:

Since it has a certain visibility, we need to ensure that:

1. CHANGELOG is up to date with any VERSION change we do.
2. VERSION is found in `gemini-extension.json`


## Symlinks

Note: Currently  `./gemini/commands/` is symlinked against `commands/` to provide dogfooding capabilities. Let's make sure new functionality is add ( and `git add`ed) to `commands/`.

When in doubt, check the official vanilla repo: https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/security/
